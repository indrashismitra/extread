Effective date: 30/1/2018

This Privacy Policy describes iReadtime’s information practices for its website and browser extension. We take your privacy seriously and want you to understand exactly what information we collect, how we use that information, which pieces of information you can request us to remove, and how to contact us about this policy. Please read this policy carefully. Your continued use of the iReadtime extension and/or the iReadtime website constitutes your agreement to this policy. When it comes to your personal information, most of this policy applies to users who donate to support iReadtime.

Information iReadtime collects

## Personal information

The iReadtime browser extension does not collect, store, or send any personal information. If you've donated to support iReadtime, personal information is collected by our payment provider, PayPal.

## Anonymous information

The iReadtime extension captures anonymous usage information, including but not limited to: button clicks within iReadtime, and iReadtime window opens. It does not capture any text that iReadtime runs on. Also, iReadtime may capture various activity pixels that are used on some websites. All such data is captured anonymously and no user level data is gathered.

## Analytics

iReadtime uses analytics services, like Google Analytics, to aggregate information about traffic patterns and how our website and extension are used, for the sole purpose of improving our extension and website.

## How iReadtime uses and discloses collected information

We try to make iReadtime better

We use the collected and anonymous usage and analytics information to maintain and improve the iReadtime extension and website, gain insight into how our services are being used. The information is only used internally.

## Your personal information is not for sale

iReadtime never has and never will sell your personal information to any third party without your consent.

## Anonymized data may be shared to help support the app

We sometimes share anonymized, hashed, obfuscated, and/or aggregated information with third parties or the public in order to support the app and help pay for expenses. This information cannot be associated with an individual or any personal information, though the third parties may combine it with other anonymized data from other sources. If you'd like to opt out of this, visit this site.

## Data security

iReadtime does not store any data whatsoever; any data that is captured by the Chrome extension is sent to a third-party (e.g. for Analytics purposes) via secure HTTPS connecitons, and are subject to the security considerations of their severs and databases. If you've donated to support iReadtime, your personal information is never shared, and is kept safe within the security precautions of our payment provider (PayPal). That said, no database or server is 100% secure and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your data in any system, or while being transmitted over the Internet. Our best effort is given, but you use iReadtime’s browser extension and website at your own risk.

Changes and updates to this policy

iReadtime reserves the right to change this policy for any reason, and may make small, inconsequential changes to this policy with or without notice. Each time this policy is changed we will revise the “Effective Date” at the top of this page.
